RULE => (working copy => staging area => repository)

git init
git add . (adding to staging area, i.e., to update what will be commited.)
git commit -m "first commit" when moving from working copy to staging area)
git commit -am "first commit" (when moving from working copy to directly to repository, **only in case of simple edits and modification and not renames)
git log (to view git history)
git log --author="vikasM30"
git status
git restore --staged <file>  (to restore after [git add .] is been made)
git restore <file>  (to restore before [git add .] is been made, almost same as [git checkout -- <File>])
git diff (shows the differences to local to staging area)
git diff --staged (shows the differences to staging area to repository)
git mv <file1> <file2> (rename from file1 to file2)
git mv <file1> <Folder>/<file2> (rename and mv from file1 to inside Folder/file2)
git checkout -- <File> ("DISCARD" changes in the working area => here we undo the changes made by anyone by replacing it by repository file [i.e., CHECKOUT => take something from repository and make it your working copy], **file must not have not been commited.)
git reset Head <file> (to unstage a file, i.e., if you have added files to stagging area [git add .] and later you found that you have done wrong something.)
