git commands
RULE => (working copy => staging area => repository)

git init
git add . (adding to staging area, i.e., to update what will be commited.)
git commit -m "first commit" when moving from working copy to staging area)
git commit -am "first commit" (when moving from working copy to directly to repository, **only in case of simple edits and modification and not renames)
git log (to view git history)
git log --author="vikasM30"
git status
git restore --staged <file>  (to restore after [git add .] is been made)
git restore <file>  (to restore before [git add .] is been made, almost same as [git checkout -- <File>])
git diff (shows the differences to local to staging area)
git diff --staged (shows the differences to staging area to repository)
git mv <file1> <file2> (rename from file1 to file2)
git mv <file1> <Folder>/<file2> (rename and mv from file1 to inside Folder/file2)
git checkout -- <File> ("DISCARD" changes in the working area => here we undo the changes made by anyone by replacing it by repository file [i.e., CHECKOUT => take something from repository and make it your working copy], **file must not have not been commited.)
git reset Head <file> (to unstage a file, i.e., if you have added files to stagging area [git add .] and later you found that you have done wrong something.)

Getting older version from the repository

If you have done,
first > second > third commits
but you find you made a wrong commit in third commit, and you want to switch to second commit
git checkout <gitCommitID> -- <file>
and then re commit it again.

git push (to push on repository)

To push your work to github repository through terminal

step1: git init
step2: git commit -m 'message'
step3: git remote add <nick_name_to_GithubRepo_Link> GithubRepo_Link
step4: git push -u <nick_name_to_GithubRepo_Link> <branch>


Head => it points to the last commit made
First one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. Second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit youâ€™ve made.
